# circuit-watcher
Auto-accept League of Legends queue (any).\
Small project I've been working on (doesn't even have an icon yet) and plan to update and work on more features, although nothing too crazy.\
There's also probably a whole lot of better ways to do the stuff I'm doing but there's not much to base the project off of and even less in rust.

#### BUILDING/DOWNLOADING
Should be as easy as doing
```sh
git clone https://github.com/TacticalDeuce/circuit-watcher.git
cd circuit-watcher
cargo build --release
```
or downloading through the [release page](https://github.com/TacticalDeuce/circuit-watcher/releases)

#### TODO
- [x] Queue auto-accept
- [ ] Terminal timestamps
- [ ] Champ auto-pick
- [ ] Champ auto-ban
- [ ] Maybe queue rejoining?
- [ ] Maybe an interface?
